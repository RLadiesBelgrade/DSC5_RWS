##Before there was R, there was S! 🤠

**R** is a dialect of **S** language that was developed in 1976 by *Rick Becker* and *John Chambers* at the  Bell Laboratories.

*Rick Becker* gave an excellent keynote talk *"Forty Years of S"* at UseR!2016 conference:   
[Rick Becker @ UseR!2016](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2016/07/rick-becker-s-talk.html) where he talked about development of **S** language that gives explanations for many characteristics of **R** as we know it, including "<-" assignment operator.

1993 Bell Labs gave StatSci (later Insightful Corp.) an exclusive license to develop and sell the **S** language. Insightful sold its implementation of the **S** language under the product name **S-PLUS**.

You can read more about the [history of S, R, and S-PLUS](https://www.whoishostingthis.com/resources/s-plus/)
---
## then, R was born 😇🎶
In early nineties at the University of Aucklandn in the Department of Statistics **R** was created by *Ross Ihaka* and *Robert Gentleman*.

They used [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) to make R open source free software. 

**R**oss Ihaka and **R**obert Gentleman. *R: A language for data analysis and graphics.* Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 5(3):299–314, 1996

Currently **R** is developed by the **R Development Core Team**, of which *John Chambers* is a member.

##Write R Code

To start using **R** you need to:

1) Install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) [(and RStudio)](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

2) Launch it and set your working directory: letting R know where to find all of your files.

3) Start writing **R** code!

**Tip**💡:
- When start working on a new R code/R Project in [RStudio IDE](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/sections/200107586-Using-the-RStudio-IDE) use 
***File -> New Project*** 
This way your working directory would be set up when you start a new project and it will save all your files in it. Next time you open your project it would set project's directory as a working directory... It would help you with so much [more](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects).

##Dataset

**gapminder** dataset available from **gapminder** package.
For each of 142 countries, the package provides values for life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population, every five years, from 1952 to 2007.

```{r tidy=FALSE, echo = FALSE}

DT::datatable(head(gapminder::gapminder, 4))

```

Note thet there are 6 columns, each of which we call a **variable**.

##Before Tidyverse R, there is Base R!
When you download and install **R** for the first time, you are installing **the Base R** software. **Base R** contains most of the functions you’ll use on a daily basis: `mean()`, `subset()`...

To learn about **R**'s basic operations, data structures and base functions you could look at one of the R-Ladies Manchester's handouts: [Introduction to base R](https://tanjakec.github.io/blog/introduction-to-r/).

If you want to access data and code written by other people, you’ll need to install it as a **package**. An **R package** is a bundle of functions (code), data, documentation, vignettes (examples), stored in one neat place.

"In **R**, the fundamental unit of shareable code is the package." [Hadley Wickham](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/intro.html)

##The <span style="color:blue">`dplyr`</span> Package: 
provides a “grammar” (the verbs) for data manipulation and for operating on data frames. The **key opertor and the esential verbs** are :

- <span style="color:blue">`%>%`</span>: **the “pipe” operator** used to connect multiple verb actions together into a pipeline.

- <span style="color:blue">`select()`</span>: return a subset of the columns of a data frame.

- <span style="color:blue">`mutate()`</span>: add new variables/columns or transform existing variables.

- <span style="color:blue">`filter()`</span>: extract a subset of rows from a data frame based on logical conditions.

- <span style="color:blue">`arrange()`</span>: reorder rows of a data frame according to single or multiple variables.

- <span style="color:blue">`summarise()`</span> / <span style="color:blue">`summarize()`</span>: reduces each group to a single row by calculating aggregate measures.

##Gapminder Data

Excerpt of the Gapminder data on life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population by country.

The main data frame gapminder has **1704 rows** and **6 variables**:
- **country**: factor with 142 levels
- **continent**: factor with 5 levels
- **year**: ranges from 1952 to 2007 in increments of 5 years
- **lifeExp**: life expectancy at birth, in years
- **pop**: population
- **gdpPercap**: GDP per capita

```{r tidy=FALSE}
gapminder::gapminder[1:3,]
```

Now we're ready to start practicing Elain's Dance!!! 😃🎵🎶

```{r, out.width = "300px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ElainDanceI.png")
```
---
## 1st look at the data: <span style="color:blue">`dim()`</span> & <span style="color:blue">`head()`</span>

```{r, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
dim(gapminder)
head(gapminder, n=10)
```
---
##Examine the structure of the data: <span style="color:blue">`str()`</span>
```{r}
str(gapminder) 
```

The **output could look messy** and it might not fit the screen when dealing with a big data set that has lots of variables! 🤪
---
##Do it in a tidy way: <span style="color:blue">`glimpse()`</span>

```{r, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
glimpse(gapminder) 
```
---
##The pipeline operater: <span style="color:blue">`%>%`</span>
<pre>
**Left Hand Side (LHS)**   <span style="color:blue">`%>%`</span>    **Right Hand Side (RHS)**
</pre>
<pre>
<span style="color:blue">x %>% f(..., y)</span> 

<span style="color:blue">    f(x,y)</span>
</pre>

The "pipe" passes the **result** of the **LHS** as the 1st operator argument of the **function** on the **RHS**

<pre>
<span style="color:blue">3 %>% sum(4)</span>      <==>      <span style="color:blue">  sum(3, 4)</span>
</pre>

<span style="color:blue">`%>%`</span> is very practical for chaining together multiple <span style="color:blue">`dplyr`</span> functions in a sequence of operations.
---
##pick variables by their names: <span style="color:blue">`select()`</span>,
```{r, out.width = "450px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/select().png")
```

- <span style="color:blue">`starts_with("X")`</span> every name that starts with "X".

- <span style="color:blue">`ends_with("X")`</span> every name that ends with "X".

- <span style="color:blue">`contains("X")`</span> every name that contains "X".

- <span style="color:blue">`matches("X")`</span> every name that matches "X", where "X" can be a regular expression.

- <span style="color:blue">`num_range("x", 1:5)`</span>  the variables named x01, x02, x03, x04, x05.

- <span style="color:blue">`one_of(x)`</span> => every name that appears in x, which should be a character vector.
---
##Select your variables
1) that ends with letter `p`

2) starts with letter `co`. Try to do this selection using base R.  
---
##Solutions:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
gm_pop_gdp <- select(gapminder, ends_with("p"))
head(gm_pop_gdp, n = 1)
gm_cc <- select(gapminder, starts_with("co"))
head(gm_cc, n = 1)
```
of course all of this could be done using **base R** like for example:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
gm_cc <- gapminder[c("country", "continent")]
```
but it's less intuitive and often requires more typing. 
---
##Create new variables of existing variables: <span style="color:blue">`mutate()`</span>
```{r, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/mutate().png")
```

It would allow you to add to the data frame `df` a new column, `z`, which is the multiplication of the columns `x` and `y`: `mutate(df, z = x * y)`.
If we would like to observe `lifeExp` measured in months we could create a new column `lifeExp_month`: 
```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapminder2 <- mutate(gapminder, LifeExp_month = lifeExp * 12) 
head(gapminder2, n = 2)
```
---
##Pick observations by their values: <span style="color:blue">`filter()`</span>
```{r, out.width = "450px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/filter().png")
```

There is a set of logical operators in **R** that you can use inside `filter()`:

- `x < y`: `TRUE` if `x` is less than `y`
- `x <= y`: `TRUE` if `x` is less than or equal to `y`
- `x == y`: `TRUE` if `x` equals `y`
- `x != y`: `TRUE` if `x` does not equal `y`
- `x >= y`: `TRUE` if `x` is greater than or equal to `y`
- `x > y`: `TRUE` if `x` is greater than `y`
- `x %in% c(a, b, c)`: `TRUE` if `x` is in the vector `c(a, b, c)`
- `is.na(x)`:  Is `NA`
- `!is.na(x)`: Is not `NA`
---
##Filter your data:

Use `gapminder2` `df` to filter:

1) only Europian countries and save it as `gapmEU`

2) only Europian countries from 2000 onward and save it as `gapmEU21c`

3) rows where the life expectancy is greater than 80

Don't forget to **use `==` instead of `=`**! and
Don't forget the quotes ** `""` **
---
##Solutions:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapmEU <- filter(gapminder2, continent == "Europe") 
head(gapmEU, 2)
```
```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapmEU21c <- filter(gapminder2, continent == "Europe" & year >= 2000)
head(gapmEU21c, 2)
```
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
filter(gapminder2, lifeExp > 80)
```
---
##Reorder the rows: <span style="color:blue">`arrange()`</span>
is used to reorder rows of a **d**ata **f**rame (df) according to one of the variables/columns.

```{r, out.width = "300px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/arrange().png")
```

- If you pass `arrange()` a character variable, **R** will rearrange the rows in alphabetical order according to values of the variable. 

- If you pass a factor variable, **R** will rearrange the rows according to the order of the levels in your factor (running `levels()` on the variable reveals this order).
---
##Arranging your data
1) Arrange countries in `gapmEU21c` `df` by life expectancy in ascending and descending order.

2) Using `gapminder df`
  - Find the records with the smallest population
  
  - Find the records with the largest life expectancy.
---
##Solution 1):
```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapmEU21c_h2l <- arrange(gapmEU21c, lifeExp)
head(gapmEU21c_h2l, 2)
gapmEU21c_l2h <- arrange(gapmEU21c, desc(lifeExp)) #<<
head(gapmEU21c_l2h, 2)
```
---
##Solution 2):
```{r, echo = TRUE}
arrange(gapminder, pop)
```
---
```{r, echo = TRUE}
arrange(gapminder, desc(lifeExp))
```
---
##Collapse many values down to a single summary: <span style="color:blue">`summarise()`</span>
```{r, out.width = "450px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/summarise().png")
```

- uses the same syntax as `mutate()`, but the resulting dataset consists of a single row instead of an entire new column in the case of `mutate()`. 

- builds a new dataset that contains only the summarising statistics.

Use `summarise()`:

1) to print out a summary of gapminder containing two variables: max_lifeExp and max_gdpPercap.

2) to print out a summary of gapminder containing two variables: mean_lifeExp and mean_gdpPercap.
---
##Solution: Summarise your data

```{r, echo = TRUE}
summarise(gapminder, max_lifeExp = max(lifeExp), max_gdpPercap = max(gdpPercap))
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
summarise(gapminder, mean_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp), mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap))
```

## grammar of graphics
Enables you to specify building blocks of a plot and to combine them to create graphical display you want. There are 8 building blocks:

- data

- aesthetic mapping

- geometric object

- statistical transformations

- scales

- coordinate system

- position adjustments

- faceting
---
##<span style="color:blue">ggplot()</span>
1. "Initialise" a plot with `ggplot()`
2. Add layers with `geom_` functions

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 8, fig.align = 'center'}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(gapminder_pipe, aes(x = pop_e6, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(col ="red")
```
**Tip**: You can use the following code template to make graphs with **ggplot2**:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = <DATA>, (mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>)) +
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>()
```
---
#<span style="color:blue">ggplot()</span> gallery
Run the following code to see what graphs it's going to produce.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = lifeExp), binwidth = 10) +
  geom_histogram()
#
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_density()
#
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = continent, color = continent)) +
  geom_bar()
#
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = continent, fill = continent)) +
  geom_bar()
```
---
##Confer with your neighbours:

**Does the life expectancy depend upon the population size?**
$$\hat{y}=\hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1} x + e$$
Run this code in your console to fit the model `pop` vs `lifeExp`.

Pay attention to spelling, capitalization, and
parentheses!
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE, warning= FALSE}
m1 <- lm(gapminder_pipe$lifeExp ~ gapminder_pipe$pop_e6)
summary(m1)
```
---
**Can you answer the question usig the output of the fitted model?**
```{r, echo = TRUE, warning= FALSE}
m1 <- lm(gapminder_pipe$lifeExp ~ gapminder_pipe$pop_e6)
summary(m1)
```
---
## Your turn!

Use gapminder data.

**Does the life expectancy depend upon the GDP per capita?**

1) Have a glance at the data. (tip: `sample_n(df, n)`)

2) Produce a scattep plot: what does it tell you?

3) Fit a regression model: is there a relationship? How strong is it?
Is the relationship linear? What conclusion(s) can you draw?

4) What are the other questions you could ask; could you provide the answers to them?
---
## Possible Solution: code Q1; sample
```{r, echo = TRUE, warning= FALSE}
sample_n(gapminder, 30)
```
---
## Possible Solution: code Q2; Plot the data;
```{r, echo = TRUE, warning= FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8, fig.align = 'center'}

    geom_point(alpha = 0.2, shape = 21, fill = "blue", colour="black", size = 5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, col = "maroon3") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = F, col = "limegreen") 
```

## Possible Solution: code Q3; simple regression model
```{r, echo = TRUE, warning= FALSE}

## **There is a challenge:** 

- `dplyr`'s `group_by()` function enables you to group your data. It allows you to create a separate df that splits the original df by a variable.

- `boxplot()` function produces boxplot(s) of the given (grouped) values.

Knowing about `group_by()` and `boxplot()` function, coud you compute the median life expectancy for year 2007 by continent and visualise your result?
---
## Possible Solution: 

Let us look at the median life expectancy for each continent
```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent) %>%
    summarise(lifeExp = median(lifeExp))
```
